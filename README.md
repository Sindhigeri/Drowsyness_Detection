Drowsiness detection is a car safety system that monitors a driver's behavior to identify signs of drowsiness. The system alerts the driver if they are becoming drowsy so they can take action to avoid an accident.
How it works
Monitors visual cues
Drowsiness detection systems use cameras and sensors to monitor the driver's eyes, head, and facial expressions. 
Analyzes driving behavior
The system monitors the driver's steering, pedal use, and lane deviations. 
Calculates fatigue level
The system uses algorithms to calculate the driver's fatigue level based on their behavior. 
Alerts the driver
If the driver's fatigue level exceeds a certain threshold, the system alerts the driver with an icon or alarm
